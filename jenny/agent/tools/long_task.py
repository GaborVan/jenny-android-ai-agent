"""Sustained goal tools on the main agent (Codex-style).

Follow the built-in **long-goal** skill for lifecycle rules and how to phrase
objectives (especially **idempotent**, compaction-safe goals). Load that skill
from the skills listing (path shown there) before composing ``long_task.goal`` text.

``long_task`` registers an objective on the session (JSON-serializable metadata).
Active objectives are mirrored each turn into the Runtime Context block (see
``jenny.session.goal_state.goal_state_runtime_lines``) so compaction cannot hide them.
Work proceeds in ordinary agent turns (same runner, compaction as configured).
Call ``complete_goal`` when the sustained objective should stop being tracked:
finished successfully, or cancelled / superseded / redirected—in every case the recap should match reality.

There is **no** sub-agent orchestrator and **no** special WebSocket ``agent_ui`` stream.
